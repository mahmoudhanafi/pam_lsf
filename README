PAM-LSF-MODULE

HOW TO BUILD
1. Edit Makefile
   a. LSF_TOPDIR
   b. INCLUDE_DIR
   c. LSF_LIBDIR

2. make

3. Copy pam_lsf.so to /lib64/security/

4. Copy pam.d.sample /etc/pam.d/yourappname

HOW TO USE
Currently I only have "auth" and "account" functions. Both of these accecpt 
username from the application and will return PAM_SUCESS if user has a job 
running on the node where the pam_lsf.so is used. You must pass two variables 
LSF_SERVERDIR and LSF_ENVDIR. If you add "debug" to the command line option in 
the pam config file, it will provide verbose logging.  In addition, if a number 
is passed, then this module will check LSF that number of times before 
rejecting the request.  The default is five.
