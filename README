PAM-LSF-MODULE

HOW TO BUILD
1. Edit Makefile
   a. LSF_TOPDIR
   b. INCLUDE_DIR
   c. LSF_LIBDIR

2. make

3. Copy pam_lsf.so to /lib/security/

4. Copy pam.d.sample /etc/pam.d/yourappname

HOW TO USE
Currently I only have "auth" and "account" functions. Both of these accecpt username from the application and will return PAM_SUCESS if user has a job running on the node where the pam_lsf.so is used. You must pass two variables LSF_SERVERDIR and LSF_ENVDIR. You can also pass the debug options.
